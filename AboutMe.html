  <h1>
    Ivan Navarro
  </h1>
  <h2>My name is Ivan Navarro, I am currently a Senior at La Serna and I wish to explore the science around Neurology. I
    chose to do a senior project around Digital Addiction since I plan to go into the subject of neuroscience so I
    believed that this would give me some exposure to the subject, it was interesting learning more over the
    neurotransmitters and what affects addiction as well as reaching out to people to interview and gather information.
    I also decided to try coding a website to demonstrate two skills that intrest me, and with this Senior Project I had
    the ability to learn them more.</h2>
