  <h2>Biological Aspects</h2>
  <h3>Excessive screen time alters dopamine production, leading to compulsive behavior and reduced impulse control.</h3>
  <h3>Addiction has biological roots, influenced by genetics like the DRD2 gene, which affects dopamine receptors and
    increases susceptibility to addictive behaviors. In the digital age, constant dopamine surges from gaming rewards
    and notifications reinforce screen dependence, leading to excessive screen time and physical issues like eye strain
    and headaches. Gender also plays a role—males are more prone to gaming addiction, while females are more likely to
    develop social media dependency, which has been linked to depressive symptoms. Since adolescence is a critical stage
    for brain development, early exposure to digital addiction can establish long-term dependencies that are difficult
    to break.
  </h3>
  <h2>Neurological Aspects</h2>
  <h3>The brain's reward system becomes overstimulated, similar to substance addiction, making it harder to focus on
    non-digital tasks.</h3>
  <h3>The brain’s reward system plays a major role in digital addiction, with dopamine reinforcing compulsive behaviors
    like gaming and social media use. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable due to the uneven development of the
    prefrontal cortex, responsible for impulse control, and the limbic system, which drives emotional responses. This
    imbalance makes it easier for young people to develop addictive digital habits, often using smartphones and online
    platforms as coping mechanisms for social isolation or stress. Without intervention, these behaviors can disrupt
    cognitive development and increase reliance on digital engagement for emotional regulation.
  </h3>
  <h2>Social Aspects</h2>
  <h3>Adolescents experiencing digital addiction may struggle with face-to-face interactions, social anxiety, and
    withdrawal from real-world activities.</h3>
  <h3>Social influences, including social media, influencers, and algorithm-driven content, play a key role in digital
    addiction by encouraging excessive screen time. Parasocial relationships with online personalities can deepen
    isolation, while the fear of missing out (FOMO) drives constant engagement. Studies show that nearly all users
    experience anxiety when separated from their phones, and smartphone addiction is becoming a major issue in schools,
    affecting face-to-face communication. Peer influence also shapes digital habits, making interventions like
    screen-time tracking apps, offline hobbies, and parental guidance essential for reducing digital dependency.
